Idle times of personal computers have increased steadily due to generalization of computer usage and cloud computing. Clustering research aims at utilizing the idle computer resources for processing a variable work-load on a large number of computers. The work-load is processed continually despite of the volatile status of the individual computer resources. This paper proposes a distributed compilation system for improving the processing speed of CPU-intensive software compilation. This reduces significantly the compilation time of mass sources by using idle resources.
